# Weather Web
This is a simple website made for checking the weather of a country/city using WeatherAPI  
We did this proyect to practice making a python web server that uses different HTML pages with some CSS and JavaScript  
# How to use
You first need to run setup.py which will install all the dependencies and ask for your API key then you should always run app.py unless you want to change you API key
