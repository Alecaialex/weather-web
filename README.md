# Weather Web
## Overview:
Weather Web is a simple website built for checking the weather of any country or city using the WeatherAPI. We started this project to practice creating a Python web server with different HTML pages, adding a bit of style with CSS and functionality with JavaScript.

## Getting Started:
To start, run setup.py â€“ it'll sort out all the dependencies and ask for your API key. After that, just run app.py whenever you want to start the web server unless you're switching API keys.

### Credits:
